## CLI Project - Flatiron School.

In this time of the COVID-19 pandemic, most people are couped up in their houses.  They want to get outside and be active to feel some normalcy in their lives. With most national parks still open amongst the closing restrictions, visiting our country's beautiful National Parks and Historical Sites are an excellent way to get outside, get active, and be safe. 

The National Park Service (NPS) oversees 421 total units, including the 62 designated national parks. FARLAND, is a CLI program that lets users find NPS parks, trails and sites located in their 2-letter state code/territory. The program will return a numbered list of all the parks in that state/territory. The user can then type a number to get some "About The Park" information and if that park piques their interest, they can retrieve contact information by entering the contact command.

The program is named after J. Horace McFarland, one of then men behind creating the National Park Service in 1916.
